* What

This project demonstrates using [[https://postgrest.org][PostgREST]] with [[https://auth0.com/][Auth0]].

* Why

Auth0 offers [[https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications/regular-web-apps][Regular Web Applications]] as a category of application,
and has [[https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp][Quickstarts]] available for many back-end technologies.
Unfortunately, PostgREST is not one of them.  This project is an arena
for exploring, developing, and demonstrating how Auth0 can be
integrated with traditional web app that runs on a server, where that
server is PostgREST.

* How

This project uses a [[file:docker-compose.yaml][docker-compose.yaml]] file to launch two services:

- postgres :: PostgreSQL database server
- postgrest :: PostgREST API and web server

It sets up the database with [[file:initdb.d-postgres/setup.sql][setup.sql]] which does a few things:

1. Create the ~anonymous~ and ~authenticator~ database roles as per
   the PostgREST documentation on [[authentication]].
2. Create the [[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xml2.html][xml2]] extensions to enable easy templating in the
   database (analogous to but still quite different from [[https://www.php.net/][php]] or
   [[https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet][ASP.NET]], instead using [[https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/][XSLT]].
3. Create a ~resource~ view to make it easier to work with [[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/largeobjects.html][Large Objects]]
   in the database as resource files (like stylesheets).
4. Create a ~index~ function that can be [[https://postgrest.org/en/stable/references/api/stored_procedures.html#calling-with-get][called with GET]] in PostgREST
   to return a simple "index.html" generated by applying an XSLT
   stylesheet stored as a Large Object and accessed via the ~resource~
   view.
5. Loads an XSLT stylesheet [[file:initdb.d-postgres/demo.xsl][demo.xsl]] as a Large Object to be used to
   generate the "index.html" page described above.

The goal is for the "index.html" page to have a "Login" link to the
[[https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/auth0-universal-login][Auth0 Universal Login]] and also to show by way of diagnostics the
PostgREST [[https://postgrest.org/en/stable/references/transactions.html?highlight=request.cookies#request-headers-cookies-and-jwt-claims][Request Headers, Cookies, and JWT claims]] in order to exhibit
the effect of logging in with Auth0 and obtaining a JWT.

* Steps

** Step 1:  Check out the GitHub repository [[https://github.com/davidaventimiglia/postgrest-auth0-demo][postgrest-auth0-demo]].

#+begin_src bash
  git clone https://github.com/davidaventimiglia/postgrest-auth0-demo.git
#+end_src

** Step 2:  Set environment variables.

There are a variety of ways to do this.  One way is just to create a
~setenv.bash~ script and ~source~ it.

#+begin_src bash
  cat <<EOF > setenv.bash
  export LOGINURL=<Auth0 Universal Login URL>
  export PGRST_SERVER_PORT=<an available web port e.g. 3001>
  export PGPASSWORD=<a PostgreSQL password e.g. postgres>
  export PGUSER=<a PostgreSQL user e.g. postgres>
  export PGDATABASE=<a PostgreSQL database e.g. postgres>
  export PGPORT=<an available database port e.g. 5433> 
  export PGHOST=<database host e.g. localhost>
  export PGRST_JWT_AUD=<audience "aud" which for Auth0 is the Application Client ID>
  EOF
  source setenv.bash
#+end_src

** Step 3:  Retrieve the Auth0 JWKS for your tenant.

For example:

#+begin_src bash
  wget -O ./initdb.d-postgres/rsa.jwk.pub https://dev-5nectqauhb53peug.us.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

** Step 3:  Launch the services with Docker Compose.

#+begin_src bash
  docker-compose up
#+end_src

or

#+begin_src bash
  docker compose up
#+end_src

** Step 4:  Go to the index page.

Open a browser to [[http://${PGHOST}:${PGRST_SERVER_PORT}/rpc/index]] and try the
"Login" link.
